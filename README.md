## Catool

The Collaborative Annotation Tool, commonly shortened to Catool, is an academic application that gives faculty and students the ability to collaboratively annotate text, images, audio, and video. Students and faculty highlight points of interest and discussions with text or media annotations. Other users may create additional annotations, or reply to previous annotations, thus creating discussions around common points of interests.

_Please Note:_ This is *alpha* quality software that is untested in terms of production deployments. Use at your own risk.
