<h1>Start</h1>

The Video.js documentation is here to help you setup and use the player. These docs can be found and contributed to in the [Video.js library repository](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/tree/master/docs).

### [Setup](/docs/setup)
Check out the [5 second setup](/#setup) if you're just getting started. The setup documentation gives a deeper view of the additional methods you can use to trigger the player setup.

### [Options](/docs/options/)
There are a number of options that can be used to change how the player behaves, starting with the HTML5 media options like autoplay and preload, and expanding to Video.JS specific options.

### [API](/docs/api/)
The Video.js API allows you to control the video through javascript or trigger event listeners, whether the video is playing through HTML5, flash, or another playback technology.

### [Skins](/docs/skins/)
You can change the look of the player across playback technologies just by editing a CSS file. The skins documentation gives you a intro to how the HTML and CSS of the default skin is put together.

### [Tech](/docs/tech/)
A 'playback technology' is the term we're using to represent HTML5 video, Flash, and other video plugins, as well as other players like the YouTube player. Basically anything that has a unique API to audio or video. Additional playback technologies can be added relatively easily.

### [Tracks](/docs/tracks/)
Text Tracks are used to display subtitles and captions, and add a menu for navigating between chapters in a video.

### [Glossary](/docs/glossary/)
Some helpful definitions.
